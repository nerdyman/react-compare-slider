# Using `onlyHandleDraggable`

- [Detecting Touch Devices](<#detecting-touch-devices>)
- [Live Examples](<#live-examples>)

The `onlyHandleDraggable` prop moves click, touch and drag from the main slider
container to the handle.

`onlyHandleDraggable` is useful for full width/height sliders on touch devices
where the user needs to touch the slider container to scroll past it
without the slider container capturing the event, changing its position.
`onlyHandleDraggable` is also useful when comparing interactive components which
have their own pointer events, such as [embedded maps](/?path=/story/demos-custom-components--google-maps).

## Detecting Touch Devices

The library doesn't provide a method to detect touch devices as it's simple to
do natively.

```js
const isTouchDevice = window.matchMedia('(pointer: coarse)').matches;
```
