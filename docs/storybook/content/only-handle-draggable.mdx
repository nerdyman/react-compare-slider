# Using `onlyHandleDraggable`

The `onlyHandleDraggable` prop moves click, touch and drag from the main slider
container to the handle.

`onlyHandleDraggable` is useful for full width/height sliders on touch devices
where the user needs to touch the slider container to scroll past it without changing the slider position.
`onlyHandleDraggable` is also useful when comparing interactive components which
have their own pointer events, such as canvas elements.

## Detecting Touch Devices

The library doesn't provide a method to detect touch devices as it's simple to
do natively.

```js
const isTouchDevice = window.matchMedia('(pointer: coarse)').matches;
```

## Live Examples
