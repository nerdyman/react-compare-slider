# Using `onlyHandleDraggable`

The `onlyHandleDraggable` prop moves click, touch and drag from the main slider
container to the handle.

`onlyHandleDraggable` is useful for full width/height sliders on touch devices
where the user needs to touch the slider container to scroll past it without changing the slider position.
`onlyHandleDraggable` is also useful when comparing interactive components which
have their own pointer events, such as canvas elements.

It defaults to `true` on touch devices and `false` on non-touch devices.

## Detecting Touch Devices

The library automatically uses the `(pointer: coarse)` media query to determine if the device is a touch device.
You can emulate this in the browser devtools by setting the dimensions to a mobile device, e.g. and iPhone SE
in the Chrome Devtools.
