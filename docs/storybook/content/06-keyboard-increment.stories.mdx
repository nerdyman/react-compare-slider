# Using `keyboardIncrement`

The `keyboardIncrement` prop allows you to use the keyboard arrows to increment/decrement the slider
position when the slider `handle` is focused.

The increment can be either a `number` which evaluates to a pixel value or a `string` value
ending in `%`, e.g. `20%` to move the slider 20% of the total slider width in landscape mode
or height in portrait mode. A percentage is usually preferable as it adapts relatively to the width or
height of the slider, making it behaving consistently across resolutions.

If you want to effectively disable the keyboard increment, you can set the value to `0`. You can
also set it to `'100%'` to flip between each side immediately.

```jsx
// Increment by 20 pixels.
<ReactCompareSlider
  keyboardIncrement={20}
/>

// Increment by 20 percent of the slider width or height.
<ReactCompareSlider
  keyboardIncrement={'20%'}
/>
```
