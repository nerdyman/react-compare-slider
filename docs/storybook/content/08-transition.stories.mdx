# Using `transition`

The `transition` property applies a CSS transition when the slider is moved. The shorthand CSS
property syntax is used **without** the `transition-property` value. The library sets which property
to apply the transition to internally.

You may notice that the slider sometimes moves immediately to the new position, this is because the
transition only applies to `pointerdown` events to ensure the dragging movement of the slider is smooth.
This means the transition will be cancelled if `pointerdown` is followed by a `pointermove` event.

```jsx
<ReactCompareSlider
  transition="0.25s cubic-bezier(.17,.67,.83,.67)"
/>
```

<Canvas>
  <Story id="demos--transition" />
</Canvas>
