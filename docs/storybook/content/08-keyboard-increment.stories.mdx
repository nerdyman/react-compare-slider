# Using `keyboardIncrement`

The `keyboardIncrement` prop allows you to use the keyboard arrows to increment/decrement the slider
position when the slider `handle` is focused.

The increment can be either a `number` which evaluates to a pixel value or a `string` value
ending in `%`, e.g. `20%` to move the slider 20% of the total slider width in landscape mode
or height in portrait mode. A percentage is usually preferable as it adapts relatively to the width or
height of the slider, making it behaving consistently across resolutions.

```jsx
// Increment by 20 pixels.
<ReactCompareSlider
  keyboardIncrement={20}
/>

// Increment by 20 percent of the slider width or height.
<ReactCompareSlider
  keyboardIncrement={'20%'}
/>
```
