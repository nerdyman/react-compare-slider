# Using `clip`

The `clip` prop controls whether `itemOne`, `itemTwo`, or both use a clip mask to hide their content at the
slider position. With `all` (default), both images are clipped - creating a clean left/right split at the
slider position. With `clip: "itemOne"` or `clip: "itemTwo"`, only one image is clipped while the other extends
across the entire width underneath, allowing you to overlay one item on top of the other.

`clip` is essential for comparing images with transparent backgrounds. Without `clip: "all"` (default),
transparent areas would blend through to the image below, making it impossible to see the actual difference
between the two images.

In the story below, the checkerboard pattern is a background on the slider itself, the second image shown has
a completely transparent background.
