# Using `browsingContext`

The `browsingContext` prop allows you to change the target that events are bound to. By default,
`globalThis` (`Window`) is used and will cover 99.999% of use cases. However, if you are using
the library outside of current window context (e.g. an `iframe` or pop-up window) `browsingContext` can be used to set events to that target instead.

For example, if you wanted to render the slider in a popup you would use `createPortal` from `react-dom`
with the `document.body` property of the popup as the DOM node for `createPortal` and pass the popup
window context as the `browsingContext` prop.
