# Using `boundsPadding`

- [Live Examples](<#live-examples>)

The `boundsPadding` prop allows you to limit the slideable area on the Y-axis
in `portrait` mode or on the X-axis in the default landscape mode. The default
`boundsPadding` value is `0`, negative values are treated the same as `0` and
the value **MUST** be supplied as a number in pixels.

Bounds padding is useful when the slider has other components overlaying it - e.g. in a full
width/height carousel with previous and next buttons which you don't want the slider
handle to going behind.

In the example below, bounds padding prevents the slider handle from going
within range of pixels of the left or right of the slider specified by the `boundsPadding` prop. The bounds are automatically
applied to the top/bottom or right/left depending on the orientation of the slider.

```JSX
boundsPadding={80}
```
