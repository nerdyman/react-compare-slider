Thanks for contributing!

## Getting Started

This is a pnpm monorepo, consisting of the main package in [`lib`](../lib/) and
[`storybook`](./storybook/) and [`example`](./example/) packages in the `docs` directory. Don't
worry if you haven't used pnpm or monorepos before, the commands below will set everything up for you.

If you run Windows please use [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

Ensure you're using the Node version specified in [.nvmrc](../.nvmrc) and run the following to
bootstrap the project:

```sh
npm run bootstrap
# Also useful but not required, install shell auto completion for pnpm.
pnpm install-completion
```

To start the library in watch mode, run the following command:

```sh
# Run the library only, note this must run before starting Storybook.
pnpm run --filter react-compare-slider dev
# You can also run the scripts from the directory itself if you prefer.
cd lib
pnpm run dev

# Run Storybook only.
pnpm run --filter @this/storybook dev
# You can also run the scripts from the directory itself if you prefer.
cd docs/storybook
pnpm run dev

# Run example only.
pnpm run --filter @this/example dev
# You can also run the scripts from the directory itself if you prefer.
cd docs/example
pnpm run dev
```

## Testing

If you already have Storybook running, use the following command:

```sh
pnpm run test
```

If you _don't_ have Storybook running, use the following command:

```sh
pnpm run test:ci
```
